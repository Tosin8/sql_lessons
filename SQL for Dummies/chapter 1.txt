RELATIONAL DB FUNDAMENTAL
What is database? - a collections of integrated records ( a record is a representation of some physical or conceptual object).A database consists of both DATA and METADATA ( it describes the data's structure within a database). 
* Data dictionary - db storing metadata in an area, which describes the tables, columns, indexes, constraints and other items that make up the db. 

What is DBMS? - its a set of program used to define, administer and process dbs and their associated applications. ( A DBMS is the tool used to build that structure and operate on the data contained within the database). 
Scalabe - it's a dbms that runs on platforms of multiple classes, large and small. 

Flat Files - They are collection of data records, one after the another, in a specified format (a list). 
* Using a db instead of a flat file systems removes the duplication of effort.
