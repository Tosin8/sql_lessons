RELATIONAL DB FUNDAMENTAL
What is database? - a collections of integrated records ( a record is a representation of some physical or conceptual object).A database consists of both DATA and METADATA ( it describes the data's structure within a database). 
* Data dictionary - db storing metadata in an area, which describes the tables, columns, indexes, constraints and other items that make up the db. 

What is DBMS? - its a set of program used to define, administer and process dbs and their associated applications. ( A DBMS is the tool used to build that structure and operate on the data contained within the database). 
Scalabe - it's a dbms that runs on platforms of multiple classes, large and small. 

Flat Files - They are collection of data records, one after the another, in a specified format (a list). 
* Using a db instead of a flat file systems removes the duplication of effort. 

DB Models 
 - Relational Model : Relational have almost completely replaced earlier database types, because it can change the structure of a relational database without having to change or modify applications that were based on the old structures. 

 Components of a relational db
  - Relational db gain their flexibility because their data resides in tables that are largely independent of each other. Add, Delete, or change data in a table without affecting the data in the other tables , provided that the affected table is not a parent of any of the other tables. 

  Dealing with relations
   - A relationi db is made up of one/more relations. A relaiotn is a 2D array of rows and columns, containing single valued entries and no duplicate rows. Each cell in the array can have only one value and no two rows may be identical. 
   - Each row in the table also called a RECORD, or a TUPLE haods the data for a single user. 

   SCHEMAS, DOMAINS AND constraints
   A db's SCHEMAS provides an overall organization to the tables. The DOMAIN of a table column tells what values it may store in the column. CONSTRAINTS can be applied to a db table to prevent anyne from storing invalid data in the table.
