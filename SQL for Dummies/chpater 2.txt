Chapter 2 - SQL FUNDAMENTALs 

Note : 
* SQL isn't a procedural language, by simplying telling what you want instead of telling the system how to get it. 
* A query is a question you ask the database, if any of the data in the database satisfies the conditions of the query, SQL retrieves that data.
